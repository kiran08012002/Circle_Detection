# Circle_Detection using YOLOV5

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use the YOLOv5 model to detect circles in images. The model is trained on a synthetic dataset of images containing circles of various sizes, colors, and backgrounds. The project includes steps for dataset creation, model training, evaluation, and inference.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the YOLOv5 Repository

To get started, you need to clone the YOLOv5 repository and install the required dependencies. This will provide the necessary tools to train the model.

```bash
!git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
%cd yolov5
!pip install -r requirements.txt
